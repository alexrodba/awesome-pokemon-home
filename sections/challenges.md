# Challenges

## Some basic info first

I'd be remiss not to mention that Bulbapedia has an excellent guide of the challenges of Pokémon Home: https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Challenge_%28HOME%29 - so there's no need for me to replicate the content here.

The only thing worth mentioning here is that some Pokémon are needed to complete certain challenges. This gives them a higher intrinsic value and therefore can be traded better.

I have brute-forced this in many many ways. Just by way of doing wonder box trading multiple times a day, you end up completing a few challenges per week, at the beginning, fewer later on.

In my opinion, there's no need to go and pursue these challenges, as they give nothing interesting in return, so don't lose sleep over them.

If you really want to do this, read on.

## Getting ready

TBD.
