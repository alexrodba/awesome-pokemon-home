# Challenges

## Some basic info first

I'd be remiss not to mention that Bulbapedia has an excellent guide of the challenges of Pokémon Home: https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Challenge_%28HOME%29 - so there's no need for me to replicate the content here.

The only thing worth mentioning here is that some Pokémon are needed to complete certain challenges. This gives them a higher intrinsic value and therefore can be traded better.

I have brute-forced this in many many ways. Just by way of doing wonder box trading multiple times a day, you end up completing a few challenges per week, at the beginning, fewer later on.

In my opinion, there's no need to go and pursue these challenges, as they give nothing interesting in return, so don't lose sleep over them.

If you really want to do this, read on.

## Getting ready

You're already ready.

Again, check [the Bulbapedia page](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Challenge_%28HOME%29) to learn about all the challenges.

## 80/20 rule

We will use the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) for this. If you do the following, you will brute-force yourself into the 80% of the challenges with 20% of effort, or less:

* Move all Pokémon from all of your games (except Pokémon Go!) into Pokémon Home, not just one of them.
  * This will help you to complete certain "Register X" kind of challenges.
  * By moving multiple 'mons, you maximise the chances of completing the "Deposit 10 Pokémon with a Calm nature" or "Deposit Pokémon in a Dusk ball" and the like.
  * Moreover, there's even the Moves and Abilities dex, but this is only for überhardcore people.
* Move them back to the game unless you plan to trade them.
* In the case of Pokémon Go!, you will most likely have excess Pokémon. Since you get the same reward from transferring in game than to transfer them to Home, default to transfer to Home.
  * You will earn the candies all the same AND you get the chance of completing Home challenges.
  * Creatures from Go! will help you to complete the species registration challenges and to a certain extent the ones requiring you to deposit 'mons in certain balls.
  * 'Mons transferred from Go! will be assigned a nature when they arrive in Home! but I don't know if they count towards the nature challenges, to be honest.
  * Go! is specially useful for getting the starters, since you can get all of the starters there finally and have multiple of them.
* Do the "Trade" challenges one by one.
*   Don't obsess over any of them.
*   Especially, don't pay premium for any trade challenge (don't give up your legendaries or shinies because you're not patient enough).
