# How to organise your boxes

Here's how to get a neat and tidy order in your Pokémon Home boxes.

First off, it seems that it is _not_ possible to get a living dex with the free account [because it's limited to 30 pokémon](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-home-free-vs-paid-plan-features-pokemon-sw/1100-6473172/). I haven't tested it myself because I bought the paid account right away, and I strongly recommend you to do it if you are some kind of collector. If you're reading this, chances are that you are one.

I followed [Austin John Play's Home Living Dex Organizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISPbxFiZkNg) to organise my boxes, no more no less, so all credit is due to him. However, that file doesn't tell you where to start exactly. It just shows relative order from where you decide to start.

I first thought about starting in the first box, placing a Bulbasaur and then onwards we went. However, when you transfer Pokémon from Pokémon Go, by default it puts them in the first box, and this messed up with my order, as it would place them in empty slots, so it'd look like a mess after a while.

So I decided to leave the first set of boxes empty as an inbox of sorts. This way, I have a lot of space to accommodate for new 'mons without having to suffer.

Then, I started my non-shiny living dex from the box set number 2. It uses number 2 and midway through number three. There's room for a few more generations before I have to worry about finding more space.

Precisely because of that, I didn't start my living shiny dex in box set number 4. I want to have it as a buffer to be entirely safe for decades. I use this space temporarily to store all my tradeable 'mons: a few boxes full of shinies, rare 'mons (Gholdengos and Furfrous, mostly) and the leftover legendaries, so they're all easily findable.

In box sets 5 and 6, I placed my living shiny dex.

Lastly, in box set 7, I store a few extra things I want to keep around, like Event Pokémon, 'mons that can't be traded, those I want to power up shortly, and cool shinies or lvl100s I want to keep, and a few ones with Pokérus (because while in Pokémon Home, the virus doesn't go away).

Summary:

* **Box set 1:** Inbox. Use it to transfer stuff into Home and empty them periodically.
* **Box set 2:** Living dex, from #1 (Bulbasaur) to #761 (TBC).
* **Box set 3:** Living dex, up to #1025 (Pecharunt).
* **Box set 4:** Tradeable 'mons.
* **Box set 5:** Living shiny dex, from #1 (Bulbasaur) to #761 (TBC).
* **Box set 6:** Living dex, up to #1025 (Pecharunt).
* **Box set 7:** Want-to-keep 'mons (event, pokérus, level 100, etc).
