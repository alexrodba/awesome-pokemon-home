# All about trading

I am trying my best to write the holy grail of Pok√©mon Home trading, which is _not_ valid for trading in other games.

In Pok√©mon Home there are four methods of trading. I only find two of them useful, so I will focus on the first two and barely cover the other two.

In order of importance, for me:

- [Global Trading System (GTS)](#gts)
- [Wonder Box](#wonder-box)
- [Room trade](#room-trade)
- [Friend trade](#friend-trade)

# Global Trading System (GTS)

This is, by order of importance, the number one feature of this app I use the most.

There are three ways of using the GTS:

* Park up to three Pok√©mon
* Search for Pok√©mon
* Offer Pok√©mon

Let's cover all three!

## Parking Pok√©mon

You have to always have these slots filled, otherwise you're wasting your time. At the time of writing, I have the following 'mons there:

<p align="center">
    <img width="600px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9615c210-b974-4c8a-b905-bee93c83c300" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Pok√©mon Home">
</p>

When you "park" a Pok√©mon in this section, you have to specify what do you want to trade it for. Once someone meets your request, it'll trade the creatures automatically. You can take it back at any time.

I suggest leaving them a maximum of 24 hours. Longer than that, your request gets buried down the results list and your chances of completing the trade will plummet. Take them and park them back to increase chances.

Also, it's very likely that if a 'mon hasn't been traded in 24h using this method, it's because you're asking for an unfair trade.

For instance, you want to get a Cranidos because there's a [challenge](sections/challenges.md) that requires exchanging one for a Shieldon. You have to park your Shieldon and ask for a Cranidos in exchange. Easy peasy. Most likely, this trade will complate within minutes, if not seconds.

On the other end of the likelihood spectrum, you place a Caterpie and you want to get a Calyrex in exchange. In everyone's eyes, this is an unfair trade, so no one is going to take it and your Caterpie will stay there forever.

As you can see, some Pok√©mon have got some kind of intrinsic value. The more common a species/form is, the less value it has. Therefore, Caterpies, Magikarps and Rattatas, just to name a few, have little to no value, while legendaries and shinies have got higher value, of course.

But it's more complicated than that, because every new release will alter these values.

For instance, until relatively recently, people had only one Zacian and/or one Zamazenta, but they got back in raids in Pok√©mon Go around September 2024 for a week or two. Therefore, their value dropped significantly. Whereas prior to that you could trade a Zacian or Zamazenta for virtually any 'mon in the app, now you might be able to get some pretty basic shinies, if you're lucky, for them.

One important thing to notice is that the app doesn't let you request shinies, and we have to live with that.

I use the "parking" feature to exchange my excess shinies for legendaries.

* __Common shinies:__ Typically those you get no matter what, like the shiny Gyarados from years past, the shiny Ponyta from Legends Arceus or even those species that had a Community Day in Pok√©mon Go (Machop, Bellsprout, Dratini, Mankey, starters, Tynamo, Swablu, etc.) - I typically trade these for Dialgas if they're in their basic version, or Gholdengos if they're evolved.
* __Uncommon shinies:__ These are common Pok√©mon that haven't had any boost in appearance likelihood like specific events in Pok√©mon Go, and they're easy to shiny-hunt AND they're easy to distinguish. For instance, Caterpie is a common Pok√©mon but hasn't had a Community Day in Pok√©mon Go, so people don't have dozens of them. You can trade these for Gholdengos and they'll be a good trade, or for Regieleki/Regidrago/Spectrier/Glastrier/Kubfu on a good day.
* __Rare shinies:__ Pok√©mon that are hard to shiny-hunt because they're hard-to-find (rare appearances, like Binancle, Lapras or Clauncher) or because they're indistinguishable from non-shiny versions, like small 'mons (Flabeb√©) or chromatically misleading shinies (Paldean Tauros, Sprigatito, etc.). They can be traded for pretty much any legendary, if you're lucky, or for guaranteed tier-two legendaries or Gholdengo.
* __Legendary shinies:__ You can trade these for any 'mon you want. I normally trade them for Calyrex, Gouging Fire, Raging Bolt, Koraidon, Miraidon and Terapagos, nowadays.

It'd be too much work to create a classification of these tiers of Pok√©mon, not because they're 1025, but because this can change from week to week.

## Search

TBD

## Offer

Select one of your 'mons and see what people will trade it for. Don't use this feature to offer shinies because the app doesn't support this, so a regular Diglett and a shiny one will yield the same results.

This is the way to go to exchange your legendaries and ultra-rare 'mons.

I nowadays only focus on offering Gholdengos, because they yield pretty interesting results in terms of shinies, and an occasional ultra-rare legendary or two, or tier-one legendaries (Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, Calyrex, Terapagos, Ogerpon, Urshifu).

There are a few exceptions to this rule, which can be boiled down to these:

* Hisuian Typhlosion can be traded for Gholdengo.
* 'Mons from Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee can sometimes be traded for legendaries/shinies for no reason at all.
* Species that are part of a specific challenge can also bring good results too, but I don't focus on them at all.

For instance, my Kakuna from Let's Go Pikachu was traded for a Lugia, for no reason whatsoever:

My Caterpie from Let's Go Pikachu came with an even better trade:

wtf, indeed, but I'm not gonna complain üôèüèª

# Wonder box

Wonder box is one hell of a fun way to get a few new 'mons for free, trading them for a few of your own.

Players can deposit Pok√©mon into the Wonder Box, with limits based on their subscription plan‚Äîup to 3 Pok√©mon for free users and up to 10 for those with a Premium Plan.

The Wonder Box trades happen every X hours but this amount of time remains undocumented. First reports, when it first came out, indicated trades every 24 hours. However, I do get multiple times a day. I wouldn't say every hour, but definitely every 2-3 hours.

I always make use of the Wonder Box. I check the 10 'mons and send them back if they're of no use, and retain the rarer 'mons and occasional shinies and/or legendaries, if I'm lucky.

If you receive shinies and legendaries (rare, but it does occur), this is because someone decided to send them altruistically. That doesn't mean you _have to_ do it, but you _ought to_ do it to have it happen more frequently.

# Room trade

Room trade was perhaps a good idea back in the day but it's pretty unusable. The concept is simple, either join or create rooms of 20 people and trade one 'mon at a time. My experience has been pretty poor with this: I either landed in rooms with terrible 'mons being exchanged or the room was somehow cancelled and failed. I have also tried creating my own rooms and I've never gotten anyone to join, ever.

Users with a free Basic Plan can join existing trade rooms, while those with a Premium Plan have the added capability to create and host their own rooms.

My guess is that this functionality makes sense if you're in a Discord channel with sufficient people to join your open call via code or QR code. Useless otherwise.

# Friend trade

Another useless feature unless you happen to have friends in this particular app. I have not used it at all.
