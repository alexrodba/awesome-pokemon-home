# How to organise your boxes

Here's how to get a neat and tidy order in your Pokémon Home boxes.

First off, it seems that it is _not_ possible to get a living dex with the free account [because it's limited to 30 pokémon](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-home-free-vs-paid-plan-features-pokemon-sw/1100-6473172/). I haven't tested it myself because I bought the paid account right away, and I strongly recommend you to do it if you are some kind of collector. If you're reading this, chances are that you are one.
