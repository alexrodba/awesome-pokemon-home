# All about trading

I am trying my best to write the holy grail of Pok√©mon Home trading, which is _not_ valid for trading in other games.

In Pok√©mon Home there are four methods of trading. I only find two of them useful, so I will focus on the first two and barely cover the other two.

# Global Trading System (GTS)

This is, by order of importance, the number one feature of this app I use the most.

There are three ways of using the GTS:

* Park up to three Pok√©mon
* Search for Pok√©mon
* Offer Pok√©mon

Let's cover all three!

## Parking Pok√©mon

You have to always have these slots filled, otherwise you're wasting your time. At the time of writing, I have the following 'mons there:

<p align="center">
    <img width="400px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9615c210-b974-4c8a-b905-bee93c83c300" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Pok√©mon Home">
</p>

When you "park" a Pok√©mon in this section, you have to specify what do you want to trade it for. Once someone meets your request, it'll trade the creatures automatically. You can take it back at any time.

I suggest leaving them a maximum of 24 hours. Longer than that, your request gets buried down the results list and your chances of completing the trade will plummet. Take them and park them back to increase chances.

Also, it's very likely that if a 'mon hasn't been traded in 24h using this method, it's because you're asking for an unfair trade.

For instance, you want to get a Cranidos because there's a [challenge](sections/challenges.md) that requires exchanging one for a Shieldon. You have to park your Shieldon and ask for a Cranidos in exchange. Easy peasy. Most likely, this trade will complete within minutes, if not seconds.

On the other end of the likelihood spectrum, you place a Caterpie and you want to get a Calyrex in exchange. In everyone's eyes, this is an unfair trade, so no one is going to take it and your Caterpie will stay there forever.

As you can see, some Pok√©mon have got some kind of intrinsic value. The more common a species/form is, the less value it has. Therefore, Caterpies, Magikarps and Rattatas, just to name a few, have little to no value, while legendaries and shinies have got higher value, of course.

But it's more complicated than that, because every new release will alter these values.

For instance, until relatively recently, people had only one Zacian and/or one Zamazenta, but they got back in raids in Pok√©mon Go around September 2024 for a week or two. Therefore, their value dropped significantly. Whereas prior to that you could trade a Zacian or Zamazenta for virtually any 'mon in the app, now you might be able to get some pretty basic shinies, if you're lucky, for them.

One important thing to notice is that the app doesn't let you request shinies, and we have to live with that.

I use the "parking" feature to exchange my excess shinies for legendaries.

* __Common shinies:__ Typically those you get no matter what, like the shiny Gyarados from years past, the shiny Ponyta from Legends Arceus or even those species that had a Community Day in Pok√©mon Go (Machop, Bellsprout, Dratini, Mankey, starters, Tynamo, Swablu, etc.) - I typically trade these for Dialgas if they're in their basic version, or Gholdengos if they're evolved.
* __Uncommon shinies:__ These are common Pok√©mon that haven't had any boost in appearance likelihood like specific events in Pok√©mon Go, and they're easy to shiny-hunt AND they're easy to distinguish. For instance, Caterpie is a common Pok√©mon but hasn't had a Community Day in Pok√©mon Go, so people don't have dozens of them. You can trade these for Gholdengos and they'll be a good trade, or for Regieleki/Regidrago/Spectrier/Glastrier/Kubfu on a good day.
* __Rare shinies:__ Pok√©mon that are hard to shiny-hunt because they're hard-to-find (rare appearances, like Binancle, Lapras or Clauncher) or because they're indistinguishable from non-shiny versions, like small 'mons (Flabeb√©) or chromatically misleading shinies (Paldean Tauros, Sprigatito, etc.). They can be traded for pretty much any legendary, if you're lucky, or for guaranteed tier-two legendaries or Gholdengo.
* __Legendary shinies:__ You can trade these for any 'mon you want. I normally trade them for Calyrex, Gouging Fire, Raging Bolt, Koraidon, Miraidon and Terapagos, nowadays.

It'd be too much work to create a classification of these tiers of Pok√©mon, not because they're 1025, but because this can change from week to week.

## Search

Searching is my least favourite option of the three I use (Wonder box, GTS, offer/search). If you use the search option, you're always going to pay a premium.

It's a basic economy concept: you're looking for something you don't have, so people on the other end will assume that they can ask a higher price for it.

I only do it in very specific cases where I really need that one 'mon (a specific form of Alcremie, for instance) or things that are very expensive anyways (shiny legendaries). But if you're after a Kabuto from Galar, don't use search because people will be asking for a Bloodmoon Ursaluna, Raging Bolt of Galarian Zapdos in return. Nonsense.

## Offer

Select one of your 'mons and see what people will trade it for. Don't use this feature to offer shinies because the app doesn't support this, so a regular Diglett and a shiny one will yield the same results.

This is the way to go to exchange your legendaries and ultra-rare 'mons.

I nowadays only focus on offering Gholdengos, because they yield pretty interesting results in terms of shinies, and an occasional ultra-rare legendary or two, or tier-one legendaries (Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, Calyrex, Terapagos, Ogerpon, Urshifu).

There are a few exceptions to this rule, which can be boiled down to these:

* Hisuian Typhlosion can be traded for Gholdengo.
* 'Mons from Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee can sometimes be traded for legendaries/shinies for no reason at all.
* Species that are part of a specific challenge can also bring good results too, but I don't focus on them at all.

For instance, my Kakuna from Let's Go Pikachu was traded for a Lugia, for no reason whatsoever:

My Caterpie from Let's Go Pikachu came with an even better trade:

wtf, indeed, but I'm not gonna complain üôèüèª

<a name='wonder-box'></a>
# Wonder box

Wonder box is one hell of a fun way to get a few new 'mons for free, trading them for a few of your own.

Players can deposit Pok√©mon into the Wonder Box, with limits based on their subscription plan‚Äîup to 3 Pok√©mon for free users and up to 10 for those with a Premium Plan.

The Wonder Box trades happen every X hours but this amount of time remains undocumented. First reports, when it first came out, indicated trades every 24 hours. However, I do get multiple times a day. I wouldn't say every hour, but definitely every 2-3 hours.

I always make use of the Wonder Box. I check the 10 'mons and send them back if they're of no use, and retain the rarer 'mons and occasional shinies and/or legendaries, if I'm lucky.

If you receive shinies and legendaries (rare, but it does occur), this is because someone decided to send them altruistically. That doesn't mean you _have to_ do it, but you _ought to_ do it to have it happen more frequently.

How to decide which ones to keep vs. which ones to trade? I'm creating a guide in Google Sheets that you will be able to download soon.

<a name='room-trade'></a>
# Room trade

Room trade was perhaps a good idea back in the day but it's pretty unusable. The concept is simple, either join or create rooms of 20 people and trade one 'mon at a time. My experience has been pretty poor with this: I either landed in rooms with terrible 'mons being exchanged or the room was somehow cancelled and failed. I have also tried creating my own rooms and I've never gotten anyone to join, ever.

Users with a free Basic Plan can join existing trade rooms, while those with a Premium Plan have the added capability to create and host their own rooms.

My guess is that this functionality makes sense if you're in a Discord channel with sufficient people to join your open call via code or QR code. Useless otherwise.

<a name='friend-trade'></a>
# Friend trade

Another useless feature unless you happen to have friends in this particular app. I have not used it at all.

# Best strategy: Go-go-golden boi

Alright, let me share my strategy to maximise my pok√©mon portfolio.

The holy grail of getting 80% of the shinies in the game is to look for the golden boy: Gholdengo.

This is my current roster of Gholdengos:

<p align="center">
  <img width="300px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da854e01-1ffe-4716-ad9b-50af66aa8394" alt="Pok√©mon Home">
</p>

Gholdengo trades pretty well. It will get you most shiny forms in the game except of shiny legendaries and some extra rare ones like shiny Gorebyss and stuff like that.

How do you get so many Gholdengos?

* Virtually any legendary can be traded for one.
* Virtually any shiny can be traded for one.
* Some very rare pok√©mon will trade for Gholdengos, like Hisuian Typhlosion, Gorebyss/Huntail, Alcremies and a few more.

<p align="center">
  <img width="300px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1ba1784-79ad-49e7-bbe9-34a49eecfad1" alt="Pok√©mon Home">
</p>


If you can't get Gholdengos, try going one level below: Try asking for a Dialga or a Gorebyss/Huntail. Then exchange those for a Gholdengo.

For instance, these three pok√©mon...

<p align="center">
  <img width="300px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d497b2f-65a2-4206-bf79-e09046df6a51" alt="Pok√©mon Home">
</p>

... turned into three Gholdengos:

</p>

<a name='naming'></a>
# Bonus: Naming

Generally speaking, a pok√©mon with a nickname will be of less value because you're not able to rename pok√©mon whose original trainer (OT) isn't you.

Therefore, I know you wanted to name your Galarian Moltres "Jessica", Brandon, but then you won't be able to trade it for anything of value. You're spoiling it for everyone. Same with Jeremiah, who named his Charizard "Mr Bombastic":

<p align="center">

</p>

Likewise, it is immensely frustrating when you are close to completing the shiny pok√©dex and the only one missing has got a stupid nickname and you have to take it. It ruins your collection.

</p>
Appreciate your sharing love, not hate, but who really wants a shiny with this name?

<p align="center">
  <img width="300px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bcd2ef0-d37f-4a34-aa27-4403eed722d6" alt="Pok√©mon Home">
</p>
OK - I made an exception for this one. 

In my case, I did accept nicknamed pok√©mon just to get the collection complete in the first pass. Now, I'm doing a second pass where I am getting some shinies again with normal names (without nicknames, mostly) so I can get rid of 'mons with urls as names, emojis and other useless stuff.

For instance, I have made _several_ exceptions to get all of the 40592 Alcremie forms:

<p align="center">
  <img width="300px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea563abc-ba6c-419e-a59f-c1bfa8e77d5a" alt="Pok√©mon Home trade">

</p>

I know that technically you only need one instance of Alcremie for every topping, when building the shiny dex, but I actually wanted to have all of them with all of the combinations. I am _that_ hardcore.


Some others raise an eyebrow so I screenshotted them for posterity but ffs people you sick fucks:

Sure, that's the best use for a pok√©mon nickname:

Never take financial advice from Pok√©mon players:

Worst of all, I also wanted to speak up against idiots who use this game to spread hate and fascism. If you encounter anything like this, make a note of the trainer's name and report to Nintendo.

For instance, hate against other countries. That's German for "Turkey sucks":

# Bonus: Crazy trades

Every few days, I get a widly crazy trade out of nowhere, like the ones I posted above, so I have captured a few of them for your amusement. Needless to say, I also pay back when it's due when I have excess shinies and legendaries from Pok√©mon Go!
